	"_configuration.jury.introduction": "Hello! Here you can view all applications. The artist's names have automatically been anonymized. The applications are first displayed in a list. You can always return to this during the jury process. If the preview is switched on by clicking the on / off button, an image from the application will be loaded into the background as a reminder of that application's content when you move your mouse over the application name.\n\nThe most important information for each application is available at a glance in the list view. Click on an application, and you will enter the artist's portfolio.  This was submitted by the artist either as a PDF or with individual works.\n\nYou can switch between the works in fullscreen mode, watch movies, play audio files, etc. With individually uploaded works you can learn more in the \"Work Details\" infobox. This can also be switched off if you prefer a view of only the work.  The \"i\" infobox, which can also be switched on and off, shows a general artist statement.\n\nThe app was designed so you can make notes about the application in the chat area. This can be switched on and off by clicking the speech bubble icon. The chat function allows you to make and save your thoughts, as well as share them with the other jurors. This exchange is essential in facilitating a decision – it should also be fun.\n\nYou can give an overall rating for the portfolio by clicking the blue \"Rate\" button: \"Yes\" means an absolute recommendation to the other jurors to see this artist's work, \"No\" means rejected/uninteresting, \"Maybe\" means that you find this artist's work interesting, but are unsure and therefore others should see this portfolio as well. Please always briefly justify your decision with a sentence or keywords. This reasoning is, like the chat notes, for internal use only. However, a short formulation of your reasons will help everyone involved to understand the sometimes difficult decision-making process that goes into choosing Berlin Art Prize nominees.\n\nEnjoy!",
