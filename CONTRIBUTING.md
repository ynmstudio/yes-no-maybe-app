## How to contribute to YesNoMaybe application

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead contact us via email [mail@yesnomaybe.app](mail@yesnomaybe.app).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ynmstudio/yes-no-maybe-app/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ynmstudio/yes-no-maybe-app/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* **Ensure the feature request was not already promoted** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ynmstudio/yes-no-maybe-app/issues). If you find your FR there, feel free to comment/like the FR so we know more people want to see this feature implemented.

* Suggest your change in the issues tab via the **Request Feature** template and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the YesNoMaybe application in the issues tab. We plan to introduce additional communication channels in the future.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the YesNoMaybe documentation?**

* Everybody is welcome to contribute to the documentation and open a GitHub pull request.

The YesNoMaybe application and the future development is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](mailto:mail@yesnomaybe.app)!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
